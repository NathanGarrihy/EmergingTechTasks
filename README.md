# Sqrt2
## Square root of 2 in Python

# Introduction
As part of our Emerging Technologies module in Final Year we were assigned this task:
- Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. 
- Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library or otherwise. 
- You should research the task first and include references and a description of your algorithm.
This is an interesting task as finding a square root in code is made quite simple through libraries e.g. [Java.lang.Math.sqrt() Method](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-sqrt-method-examples/), but thinking of my own algorithm to find the square root of 2 will be challenging and I feel some research will be required before I can develop an accurate square root of 2 to 100 decimal places.
